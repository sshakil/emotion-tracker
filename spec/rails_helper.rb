  # feature specs with logins will fail without this truncation/transaction

  #
  # The issue likely arises because DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
  # and DatabaseCleaner.start together are not compatible with your current
  # test environment setup. This is especially true if your tests are running
  # JavaScript (with js: true) or if you are using Selenium/WebDriver.
  # Hereâ€™s why:
  #
  # Transactional Cleanup: DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction works by
  # wrapping your tests in a database transaction that gets rolled back after
  # the test. This requires all parts of the test to use the same database
  # connection.
  #
  # JavaScript Drivers: When using a JavaScript driver like Selenium, your
  # Rails app and the browser (controlled by Selenium) may run in separate
  # threads or processes, using separate database connections.
  # Transactions are not shared across connections, so the test may not
  # see data changes made inside the transaction.
